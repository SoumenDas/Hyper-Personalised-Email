# Hyper-Personalised-Email
Today there are 4 problelms in CRM Communciations:
1. We do not know best time to send communication to user.
2. We do not know best channel to send communication to user
3. The communications sent to user are not applicable to their context.
4. There is no way to pre-emptively simulate sending a communication to gauge if user would convert.

This tool tries to solve it by:
1. Analysing user events and define a perosna which represents the user. Note this persona is unique to user i.e. 1 to 1.
2. Basis the persona, available inventory and user's latest phot from instagram's pic, it will generate recommendations. To limit the scope, I have used fashion products.
3. Using the recommendations, it will generate images which shows usere wearing the recommended apparel.
4. A personalised email is generated and sent that consists of these images and recommendations.
